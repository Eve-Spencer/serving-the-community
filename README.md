Serving the Community through Data Analysis

This repository has been created for the purpose of presenting pieces of my skillset as Data Analyst to Community Servings. The summaries for each of the pieces of the portfolio are as follows:

## 1. Servings 2022-2023 (Salesforce Dashboard)
This dashboard was created through Salesforce using demographic mock data which I generated through Mockaroo. I imagined what some variables might be within their data as a basis for this. Please note, given the limitations of the generation of the data, the numbers are not accurate to the actual numbers nor proportions of what would actually be seen. This is rather an example to show my ability to create and manipulate the dashboard for Servings through Salesforce, using some of what might be used in real life. 

## 2. Sales Method Revenue (R programming)
These slides are the result of using R programming to clean, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data for a mock company, Pens and Printers. The company wanted to know which number of their three sales methods they should use in future to generate more revenue. Taking into consideration the appropriate KPIs, it turns out the method that generates the most revenue per method may actually not be the one that generated the most individual sales so far... One does always enjoy a twist at the end!

## 3. Animal Shelter AUS (Excel Dashboard)
I wanted a creative way to present some of my knowledge of Excel, while making it interactive. What resulted was this dashboard, showing demographic data from the real world at Austin TX animal shelter. Utilizing the slicers, one can view different outputs from the manipulated data, concerning different species and variables that affect them. For example, the data shows per year/quarter how many of each animal were taken in by the shelter, how many needed to be spayed/neutered, what their outcomes were, etc. This would be of use for the shelter to better understand and further analyze where further resources need to be allocated, including for what times of year in particular. 

It is my hope that this portfolio will show some of my capabilities to Servings, and allow me entrance into their agency to gain many opportunities to impress, continuing into the future.

Sincerely,
  Eve_Spencer
